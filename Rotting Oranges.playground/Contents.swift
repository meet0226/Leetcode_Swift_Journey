/**
 In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:

 the value 0 representing an empty cell;
 the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
 the value 2 representing a rotten orange.
 Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

 Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead.

 Example 1:
 Input: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
 Output: 4
 Example 2:

 Input: [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
 Output: -1
 Explanation:  The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
 Example 3:

 Input: [[0,2]]
 Output: 0
 Explanation:  Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.

 Note:
 - 1 <= grid.length <= 10
 - 1 <= grid[0].length <= 10
 - grid[i][j] is only 0, 1, or 2.
